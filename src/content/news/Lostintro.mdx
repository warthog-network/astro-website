<h1>Hey there,</h1>
<br/><br/>  



<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I have always had a creative spirit. There has always been a project in the room - A robot made of boxes, a space-station made of rolls of paper, a stash of legos never put away. The bed was in the closet. The forts were numerous, low hanging replicas of future bunkers I would hope to maintain with research gizmos and whirly twirllers.</p>  

<br/><br/> 
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I arrived at crypto currency during covid and the free time it lent me to explore the further dwellings of what came after the raspbery pi, linux, and an open-source world. 4 computers later- started because I had to find the one damaged ram stick, fueled by the excitment of actually getting mining to work, and stayed in and solidified my journey was the most effective coin I found to mine on my rigs at home, Warthog. Thanks to Bearmarket Miner's youtube videos about 10 or so months ago.</p>



<br/><br/>  
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">I studied rhetoric and english. I am a big advocate of things that feel like true discovery. Influnced by people such as 
William Blake, Kurt Vonnegut, Ernest Hemingway.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px;">It may seem like a farcry from crypto but these thinkers come to mind, when I consider crypto and its ability to cut the superfluous, peel back the veil, and toss in a little satire here and there. As I dug deeper I slowly began to discover that my own past-self had seemingly been more aligned with crypto than I thought. Over the past few years I have spent numerous hours trying to unearth any information I could use in this industry to my advantage. I rember during one of the interviews I watched, not even sure of who, a person said just start to "put-in" to the space and you will see it benifit you. Obviously due diligence is still required, but this - Lo - has been such an experince for myself.</p>

I thopught this journal entry i had from before i entered the market was relavant.

<h1>Money-</h1>    
<br/>
<p style="text-indent: 40px;">This is the market of today. Can money be avoided, yes. But only by very labored efforts. The psyche of the public would be shocked by a planned switch from our current system of notes and coins, to any new ideas of reciprocity. The individual has become dependent on the market for his sustainability. Therefore things are being cycled through the market and re-imaged rather than the individual bringing new products to the market. For any new image to rise in the place of the time-valued monopoly system, raw resources must be used to achieve the marketâ€™s dependency on the crafter, rather than the crafter being dependent on the market.</p>

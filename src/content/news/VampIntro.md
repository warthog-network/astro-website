<h1>Hello world!<h1>
<br>
<p>The name's FunVamp, and I just wanted to make a quick post to introduce myself and share why I’ve volunteered to help out with Warthog.</p>
<br>
<p>I’ve got two awesome kiddos that keep me pretty busy, along with my amazing Mrs. Vamp to keep it all balanced! I’ve been developing since I was a kid in the early ’90s—mostly self-taught, though I’ve taken plenty of classes along the way. I started out building websites for friends and family businesses, then scored a cool gig making a guild site for a rock band gaming nerd (even got some awesome free tickets from that!). About 17 years ago, I officially landed the title of "software developer" with a fantastic job. It’s been a great ride — getting to build custom solutions for security systems, network node tools, web apps, server-side scripts, and more.</p>
<br>
<p>I found Warthog through an awesome content creator, SonOfATech. When he mentioned the idea behind a balanced algorithm that could make mining more efficient for the little guy, I was hooked! I ended up chatting with some of the devs, shared my interest in learning blockchain coding, and they were super helpful — pointing me toward some great learning materials. That’s on my list now, and I’m making slow but steady progress.</p>
<br>
<p>In the meantime, there was talk about a new website. Since I’ve done my fair share of web development, I figured I’d toss my name out there and see if I could help.</p>
<br>
<p>I don’t have a lot of free time at the moment, but I’m hoping that once the holiday craziness dies down, I can jump into Discord more and chat with the community.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Wishing everyone an awesome New Year!</p>
<p>-Vamp</p>
